TITLE:     "PREDICT THE SALARY BASED ON  EXPERIENCE":
  “This project aims at predicting the salary of an candidate based on their experience,
for an example ,if the candidate with 5 years of experience,then what is the best salary should be offer to him”


OVERVIEW:
 NEGOTIABLE SALARY is play major role in selecting the right candidtes. for example if you are the HR officier, you got a candidate with 5 years
 of experiennce ,then what is the best salary you should offer to him?.
 
 
 BASIC LIBRARIES:
 1.NUMPY : The NumPy libraray is the core library for scientific computing inpython. it provides a high_perfromence multidimensional array object, and tools
 for working with theses arrrays.
 
 
 2.PANDAS: The Pandas library is built on NumPy and provides easy_to_use DATA STRUCTURE and DATA ANALYSIS tools for the python programming language.
 
 
 3.MATPLOTLIB: matplotlib is python 2D plotting library which produces publication _quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formates and interactive
 environements across platform
 
 
 STEPS INVOLVED IN EXECUTION:
 
 1.LOAD THE BASIC LIBRARIES
 2.LOAD THE DATASET
 3.GET BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE DATA
 4.DATA CLEANING
 5.CREATE DEPENDENCY(Y) AND INDEPENDENCY(X) VARIABLES
 6.DATA VISUALIZATION BEFORE THE TRAIN MODEL
 7.SPLIT DATASET TO TRAIN AND TEST
 8.APPLY LINEAR REGRESSION ON TRAIN DATASET
 9.GET THE PARAMETERS
 10.APPLY THE MODEL ON TEST DATASET TO GET THE PREDICT THE VALUES
 11.TO COMPARE THE ACTUAL OUTPUT VALUES WITH PREDICTED VALUES
 12.PREDICTION
 13.VISUALIZATING THE TEST SET RESULTS
 14.EVALUATION METRICS OF REGRESSION ALGORITHMS
 
 

CODING STEPS:

Dataset  from kaggle is used and viewed by using pandas library

Data analysis and feature engineering are done for the dataset to extract the needed feature and model is trained on various regression method

Visualization  of trained and test model is done by  using matplotlib and seaborn

Evaluating  the accuracy score by sklearn library    

The accuracy score is 98.816
